## Flag Game!

Our idea is to create a geography game consisting of primarily guessing flags. The game will have two different game modes. One is guessing a flag with four country options. The other one is to pick the correct country from a map given a flag. 
The vision is for the player to be able to pick a difficulty level and continents. 
A score will also be stored.


## To run
### `module add node`
### `npm install --save react-simple-maps`
### `npm start`

## Issue
The issue we are having is with react simple maps. The map does not render in our app, while the exact same code works on a seperate app. For some reason the map is not showing in our "Place the flag"-mode.
